# [google-repo-diff](https://atom.io/packages/google-repo-diff)

Working with [Google repo](https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/) is now beautiful.  
This plugin adapts the [git-diff minimap plugin](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-git-diff) to work with the [google-repo](https://atom.io/packages/google-repo) package.
